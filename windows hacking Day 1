My first day of intentionally interacting with windows operating system has a cyber security researcher.
i went throug:
1). https://tryhackme.com/jr/windowsfundamentals1xbx
2). https://tryhackme.com/jr/windowsfundamentals2x0x

AT this point i'm looking for a book to read about windows, i couldn't get any, the ones i found where books teaching how to hack with windows, not how to hack windows(You get?).

i learnt alot of new stuff from this 2 rooms. Some i already knew about but did not quite understand what it was and what exactly it was doing, like the task manager and all the properties in it.
The new thing i learnt about is mircosoft configuration (msconfig), i would probably be typing this command on every windows machine i lay my hands on, it is used for troubleshooting. You can get the executables for utilities like command prompt.
