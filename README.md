# My-journey-into-Winows-OS
This is a detailed documentation about how i learnt, understood, stuggled and won Windows operating system.

Why did i start doing this?
Much like everyother person studying and trying to get into cyber security(i still can't figure out the best way to spell it, but bear with me), i have passions for this field of study, naturally i'm a lazy person but this field brought me out of my shell and thanks to the great personalities i have met on twitter and linkedin who showed me the proper way to do things. So i started with tryhackme like most of us, i started learning fully at the beginning of this year(2022) till this day. One day i woke up to a certain realization that when ever i'm faced with a ctf(capture the flag) on tryhackme and it involves windows, immediately i panick, i don't like to be held hostage by anybody, not even from myself so i started taking this steps.
